# Recipe Project UI
This serves as the frontend to my recipe database project. It's purpose is to teach to provide a web interface for user interaction

At work, I tend to use Angular for my stack. As such, I don't have much experience with angular. I'm hoping this project will be an oppurtunity to flex my coding muscles and create a proper, if basic, angular UI
